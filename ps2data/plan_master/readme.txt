Experiments and data
so far this looks like where the data for events and static area data goes (not camera data).

possible candidates for script files are *.ebp

guesses
./??/event   -> event related including scripts maybe some linking to the fonts ? If someone can pick that apart maybe we can change the displayed dialogue.
./??/plan_map --> probably the static data on each area?

matching areas to english named 
./??/*/ttl_z/	seems to be the data related to the title screen

I tried replacing all of the text in the *.ebp files under ./* from .ASHE. and .BASH. to .FRAN. and nothing changed in any of the areas or events I tested.
